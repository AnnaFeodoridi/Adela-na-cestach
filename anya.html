      Hi! I'm Anya and Ima tell you smth about myself. I am (almost) 29 yo,
      Scorpio Moon and Sun, Aquarius Ascendent and maybe (just maybe) I am a
      little tiny bit obsessed with labeling peeps based on their astro signs.
      Or maybe I'm just kidding, who knows. Anyways... I really like watching
      the movies and cartoons, I have an account on
      <a href="https://letterboxd.com/a_feodoridi/">Letterboxd</a>, where I log
      the suff I liked (and not really liked). I have the sweetest cat Kiki.
      She's almost 4 yo and she warms meup at nights, sleeping next to my butt
      and preventing me from moving in bed ðŸ¥²
